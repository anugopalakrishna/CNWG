**Instructions:**

1. Read the content provided. 
2. Always use sentence case for titles. 
2. The Five Information Types are Task, Process, Principle, Concept, and Reference. Each type is described in the Information Types and Titling Rules section, along with instructions on how to Title them.
3. Refer to the Information Types and Titling rules and Identify the Information Type (Infotypes) of the block of data.
4. If the Block of Data contains multiple information types, separate it into Chunks. Chunks with the same information type must be grouped together in a block, and placed one after the other within this block. For example, if you identify multiple concepts, place them one after the other in the concept block.
5. Title each chunk according to the rules for that information type. Ensure that the content in the chunk matches the title. 
6.  Before presenting the chunks with an introductory concept chunk extracted from the content provided. Do not include any information from the prompt.
7. Present each chunk according to the Format of that Info Type. Always write in active voice and present tense. Give preference to second person.
8. Present each chunk using the following formula: 
   - **#{{Title in Bold}} {{(Information Type in Bold)}}**
   - {{Chunk}}
9. Present the entire content in markdown format. Check if any content is missing from the original attachment and present that as a separate section. 
10. Refer to the content once again and ensure no content is missing. 
11. Always use sentence case for titles.

     “The key components that are involved in the DHCP process are:
         • DHCP server: The entity that manages the allocation of IP addresses and other network configuration
         parameters to DHCP clients. It listens to DHCP requests and responds with the necessary information.
         • DHCP client: A device (such as a computer, smartphone, or printer) that requests network configuration
         information from a DHCP server to join the network.
         • DHCP relay agent: A network device that forwards DHCP messages between clients and servers when
         they are not on the same local network segment.”
   - **Stages Example**:
         “The DHCP process involves a series of message exchanges between the DHCP client and server to dynamically assign IP addresses and network configuration parameters. The key components—DHCP server, DHCP client, and DHCP relay agent—work together to discover available servers, offer IP addresses, request and acknowledge the lease, and to periodically renew the lease to maintain network connectivity.
   - **Result Example**: “The DHCP process results in the efficient and automated configuration of network devices, ensuring they have the necessary IP addresses and network settings to operate effectively within the network.”

3. **Principle**
   - **Purpose**: Advises what to do or not do, and when. Includes items ranging from light gravity (or seriousness) to heavy gravity.  The increasing order of gravity is an include these in increasing order of gravity: “Tip,” Note” or Recommendation” or "Guidelines" or "Best Practice" or "Requirement" or "Caution" or "Policy" or "Warning" or "Code".
   - **User Response**: Identify the principle and its importance.
   - **Titling**: Express the gravity first and the principle later or vice versa. Use the second person, imperative.
   - **Rules for principle body**:  Use active voice, imperative, and present tense non-command-form verb while addressing the user for principles of light gravity (tips, recommendations). Use a positive language. Avoid using 'do not' except when the consequenes are severe. C  Use a tone that matches the gravity of the principle. 
      - Light Gravity - say "You can" or "We recommend"
      - Moderate Gravity - say "Ensure that…"
      - Heavy Gravity - say "Use the screws included with the kit to mount the brackets in the rack."
  Present the Principle info type in the following format:
   - **Format**
      {{Title in the form of Gravity + principle or Principle + Gravity}}

      {{A block of content that defines the item (definition block) written as: A [term] is a [category] that [key attribute], [key attribute], and, [key attribute]. Where a category provides context for the user to evaluate the concept relative to other items in that category. Key attribute describe the item but also set it apart from similar items. }}
      {{Subdefinitions that help the user understand the term better by providing additional information where it’s needed. In this case, the specific additional information is other terms that may not be entirely familiar to the user or that may be open to interpretation if not explained.}}
      {{optional onformation that expands on the definition of the concept or adds further data, rationale, or explanation of the concept}}

Title: Routed PON solution
Body:
  - Advantages of routed PON solution
  - The routed PON solution enhances network efficiency and lowers costs by offering a streamlined infrastructure that:
    - eliminates third-party hardware for OLTs which streamlines infrastructure and reduces vendor dependency,
    - simplifies deployment and upgrades through the PON Manager, offering centralized management, and
    - reduces the physical footprint of network equipment, and reduces the OLT deployment costs compared to chassis-based solutions.

Title: Configure the NetFlow version 9 protocol
Body:
To monitor traffic, you must configure one or more Flow Exporter, associate it to a Flow Monitor Flow Monitor, and enable NetFlow on the interface either in egress or ingress direction. Optionally, you can configure a Flow Sampler to set the sampling rate for flow samples.

Before you begin: 

First, let us gather the required details to enable NetFlow on a router:
  Procedure:
    1. Configure a Flow Exporter  to specify where and how the packets should be exported.
    2. Create a Flow Monitor  with the flow monitor-map command to define the type of traffic to be monitored. You can include one or more exporter maps in the monitor map. A single flow monitor map can support up to eight exporters.
    3. Use the sampler-map command to configure a Flow Sampler  to define the rate at which the packet sampling should be performed at the interface where NetFlow is enabled.
    4. Apply a Flow Monitor Map and a Flow Sampler on a physical interface  to enable NetFlow on the router.

What to do next: You can now analyse the exported data using a NetFlow Analyser.

TItle: How DHCP servers work
Body:
In modern IP networks, network devices need unique IP addresses and other network configuration parameters to communicate effectively. Manually configuring these settings for each device can be time-consuming and error-prone, especially.
  
The key components that are involved in the DHCP process are:
- **DHCP Server**: The entity that manages the allocation of IP addresses and other network configuration parameters to DHCP clients. It listens to DHCP requests and responds with the necessary information.
- **DHCP Client**: A device (such as a computer, smartphone, or printer) that requests network configuration information from a DHCP server to join the network.
- **DHCP Relay Agent**: A network device that forwards DHCP messages between clients and servers when they are not on the same physical subnet.
  
The DHCP process involves a series of message exchanges between the DHCP client and server to dynamically assign IP addresses and network configuration parameters. The key components—DHCP server, DHCP client, and DHCP relay agent—work together to discover available servers, offer IP addresses, request and acknowledge the lease, and periodically renew the lease to maintain network connectivity.

The DHCP process results in the efficient and automated configuration of network devices, ensuring they have the necessary IP addresses and network settings to operate effectively within the network.”
