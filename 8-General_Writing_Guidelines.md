     Ensure that the point of view is clear and does not shift mid-sentence or paragraph.

3. **Subject and Verb Placement**  
   - **Rule:** Position the verb as close as possible to the subject, with minimal intervening words.  
     This improves clarity and makes technical content easier to follow.

4. **Stress Position**  
   - **Rule:** Place the most important or meaningful part of a sentence **at the end** to increase emphasis and help with reader retention.

5. **Multiple Stress Points**  
   - **Rule:** When a sentence contains multiple important elements, consider converting it into an **unordered list** for better readability and impact.
